Single User Dash - Chrome Extension
=======================

Many tumblr blogs have really horrible themes. They look terrible, hog your resources, or worse, both. Fortunately, Joe Anzalone wrote the Single User Dash page (http://singleuserdash.joe.im/) which makes a tumblr blog look like it is on a dashboard-like theme. 

This extension provides a page action button to redirect you to the Single User Dash version of the current tumblr you're viewing. It also provides an Omnibox keyword (sdash) to bring you to the desired tumblr on Single User Dash.

The source is available on Github:

Known issues:
- Only works on tumblr.com URIs. If the tumblr is on a person's custom domain, I don't know that it's a tumblr (and don't have permission to it). Use the Omnibox for this if you can guess the tumblr username. I'm considering providing Omnibox suggestions based on the current tab's contents.
- No support for single posts. If you use the Single User Dash button on a post it will bring you to the full blog. There's not currently a way around this.
